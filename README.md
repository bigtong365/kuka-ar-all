## Avaliable configurations üìö 

### `KukaComm` 
Dedicated server side application that serves as a middle-man between KUKA robot and Android application. We recommend using it whenever you have an access to physical robot.

### `TestSocket`
Side project that was created for an easier Android app development. It sends data similar in values and identical in form as `KukaComm`, but those values are mocked on the server side. It is used when implementing new features or debugging an Android app. Eliminates the need for a robot or a robot connection access.

### `Android app`
In order to receive data and work properly, both applications have to be connected to the same local network.

## Troubleshooting üêõ üí° 

### Connection refused üì∂ 
Check if: 
- Android app is configured with a correct server IP address 

        More options icon > Reconfigure server > *here enter correct IP address*

    *More options icon can be found in left upper corner of your phone.*
- Chosen Spring server (either [KukaCommm](/README.md#kukacomm) or [TestSocket](/README.md#testsocket) is running 
- Android device is connected to the the same network as a server

### Unity editor is not showing your device üì¥ 
#### `Developer options disabled`
Check if you have `Developer options` enabled on your device.

        Settings > System > About phone - click on it several times

Usual amout of click is between 7 and 10. Remember that location of `About phone` tab can differ between manufacturers.

#### `ADB is not detecting device`
Go to

     Settings > Developer Options > Revoke USB debugging authorization

if `Revoke USB debugging authorization` is not available, do not worry.
Turn off and then on USB debugging and confirm all popups.

### Other problems ‚ö†Ô∏è 
#### `Play store check`
If your device shows a window with option to send the app for Google Play store check, please skip it as this app currently is not avaliable in production ready state.

#### `App install problem`
Check if you have "install from unknown sources" enabled in your device settings. If so, then try to install it several time and if popup with warning occurs - ignore it. If this won't help try to install a previous version.
